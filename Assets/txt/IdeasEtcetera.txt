Rhythym Stealth Game

Musical Columns add Notes when player moves
Left = First Columns
Up = Second Columns
Down = Third Columns
Right = Fourth Columns

The direction you move always adds a note, while a note will randomly be added to a remaining column.
Each pair should result in a unique sound. and be played when the user has hit all notes.


Player moves with arrow keys
Player uses Number Row 1-4 to hit the notes in each column.
Each movement bumps a note onto a column
If they are in the hit section, the number row can be used to hit that note.
If it progresses past the hit section the note is missed.


The Player must pick up the key from an office, and get to the exit.
The Player can't miss more notes than 25% of the required steps to get to the key and then to the exit.
The Success/fail state of the musical portion will be displayed.
The player can't be seen by a guard or they lose.
Guards have visible vision cone, which checks for collisions and then raycast to see if they have line of sight.

//If they don't move in a given time frame, drop new random notes.
//Maybe allow players to hide in lockers.

TODO:
Make Simple layout with walls, walkable locations, a key location, guard locations, and an exit location.
Can do this in Gimp as pixels, and generate blocks and starting locations for objects using a script based on the colors.

Make guards pathfind.
Give guards visible cone and raycast to see if they detect player.
Make player move a square at a time when they press the arrow keys.
Post Tutorial Splash Screen showing what each button does.
Add GUI element to show when the notes can be hit.
Make player collide with key and set a bool to true.
Make player collide with door and if the bool is true then load win scene.
Add escape button to pull up pause menu. Simply pause the game, show a fancy panel, the word paused, and unpause if they hit escape again.
